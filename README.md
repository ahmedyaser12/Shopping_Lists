# Flutter Shopping List App

A Shopping Lists app in Flutter is an application that helps users create and manage shopping lists. Here are some key components that would be involved in building a Shopping Lists app in Flutter:
1-Shopping list creation: Users should be able to create multiple shopping lists for different stores or occasions. They should be able to add items to the shopping list by typing them in or selecting them from a pre-defined list of items.
2-Item management: Users should be able to manage the items on their shopping list by marking them as completed or deleting them. They should also be able to edit the quantity.
